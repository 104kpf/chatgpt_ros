## 11320PME 526000 Robotics LAB
This experiment integrates digital control and robotic arms, using the ROS system to simulate a virtual environment and deploy it onto a real-world robotic arm to accomplish the Hanoi Tower transportation task. The process combines ChatGPT for voice command inputs and leverages camera vision for obstacle avoidance to successfully complete the task. The experiment is divided into five phases, which are:
1.Familiarize with the ROS system architecture, GPT API integration, and the design of the robotic arm motor controller.
2.Control the robotic arm's movement via keyboard in a virtual environment.
3.Deploy the system onto the robotic arm and control it using the keyboard.
4.Complete the Hanoi Tower transportation task in the virtual environment.
5.Participate in a physical competition.
